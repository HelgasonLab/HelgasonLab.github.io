I am currently investigating the role of serine metabolism in leukaemic stem cells both in vivo and in vitro through genetic, pharmaceutical and dietary interventions. Through the use of metabolomic analysis, high-resolution respirometry and analysis of large single cell RNAseq datasets I aim to uncover the metabolic vulnerabilities that may be valid therapeutic strategies to target one carbon metabolism.

My postdoctoral training in the Larsson lab focussed on the role of mitochondrial biology and metabolism in lung adenocarcinoma in vivo. To investigate this, I generated new mouse models to examine the impact of modulating mitochondrial biology on tumour growth and cell culture models to elucidate cell-autonomous mechanisms in tumour aggressivity. My research has contributed to a greater understanding of the impact of mitochondria dynamics in lung cancers
