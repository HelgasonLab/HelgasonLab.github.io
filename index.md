# Helgason Laboratory

We're a leukaemia research lab at the University of Glasgow. We focus on bench-to-bedside translational research. Our focus has been on Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia (CML), a tumour type in which Glasgow has particular clinical expertise and excising translational projects.

## Highlights

{% capture text %}

We are interested in related leukaemias and myeloproliferative neoplasms, with the overall aim of targeting appropriate therapy to the stem cell compartment to remove the population in which drug resistance occurs. All ongoing projects relate to targeting: Leukaemia Stem Cells, Autophagy, Cancer Metabolism, Leukaemia Niche.

We are well aware of the importance of engagement with end users and external bodies. Through fundraising/public engagement events, we provide knowledge to patient groups/charities, which will help raise awareness of the disease. We are active members of a fundraising committee and manage Helgason Lab social media accounts (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter).
